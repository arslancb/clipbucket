README FILE \

If you are having issues with the mass_uploader.php \{newest file\} then use this one, in which it fixes the Global variable issues that are used via other Add-on/Plugins. Mostly, for Ultimate pack, I\'92m not sure if anyone has fixed this yet or notice this issue. But, it seems it hasn\'92t been fixed in 2.8.3. I\'92m hoping in the next version, someone will troubleshoot this and able to find a fix to help with other add-ons/plugins in the future. \
